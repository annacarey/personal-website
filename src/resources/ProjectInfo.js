		longDescription: "Graffiti the Internet began as a project called 'Mood Tagging', a virtual spray painting experience that maps is an immersive live painting installation. Mood Tagging consists of a spray paint can with a Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) and a thermotropic crystal sheet that senses the user's temperature. When the user presses down on the nozzle, the user's temperature is mapped to his or her mood (like a mood ring) and a Microsoft Kinect records the hand movement, so digital spray paint appears on the screen above. The experience was created using Microsoft Kinect, Arduino, and Processing. The final iteration, 'Graffiti the Internet' is a live outdoor painting installation on a real window. The Microsoft Kinect receives the imagery from the window, so as the user is spray painting, the application processes each pixel of the image, filters out the colors that match the spray paint, and displays those pixels on a webpage. The project was created as part of Gray Area's Creative Coding Immersive during my fellowship in the Summer of 2015.",

The most interesting part of this project was building out the portfolio functionality. I am storing all of the info about each project in an array of objects, each containing the same kind of data (stored in ProjectInfo.js). I loop through the array and for each project, I create a route dynamically and render the PortfolioItem component, passing the entire project object down as a prop. This makes it seamless for me to add new projects to my portfolio as all I need to do is add a new object to the array in ProjectInfo.js with the appropriate data and then add a new nav box to the /portfolio page with the new link.",

		longDescription: "Exploring different ways of building a scraper using Python, the first programming language I learned in college at UC Berkeley but have not been using recently. The IMDB example was very straightforward because they had consistent classnames. Instagram was much more complicated because they use Flexbox so their classnames are created dynamically. I used XML parsing to access the elements. I ended up creating a command line tool that allows you to input the tag name you want to search. The scraper then looks at the nine posts in the featured section and accumulates the comments into an array. As a next step, I will look at searching the comments for particular phrases like 'am or pm' or days of the week to see if I can determine if they include a schedule.",
